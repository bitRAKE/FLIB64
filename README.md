### Sniplet library for FASM

_About_
This is my collection of routines uses through my work. It will grow slowly as I extend my area of discovery. Not your typical library of code because it's macro's and sniplets to inspire or augment, rather than drop in solutions. Some of this is due to specific nature of assembler.


### News:

Currently playing catch up as I go through my past projects prune fragments for this library. It's initial grow is going to be sporadic at best.
